directions:
You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

psuedocode:
-use a bootstrap form, 5 true/false multiple choice style questions
-create a startGame() function, which will have the contents of the entire 
game in it. this main function will have a timer associated with it, so that
when the timer runs out, another function gameOver() will be called, which ends the game
-using a series of conditional statements, check to see if the user enters the right answer, and add to the right and wrong answer counters. if the user does not 
respond to a question, add to the unanswered counter. display these on the game over screen
-set all the wrong answers to false, and the right answer to true.
-onclick="myFunction()" use this and jquery so that when the user
clicks on the right answer, it sets userAnswer = true;

variables: 
var correct = 0;
var incorrect = 0;
var unanswered = 0;

functions:
startGame()- starts the game and displays the questions
questions()- will be called after startGame, houses all the questions,
and the logic for recording correct and wrong answers, as well as unanswered
gameOver()- ends the game, and displays the number of correct answers, wrong 
answers, and unanswered questions
built-in: setInterval(), clearInterval(), timeOut()
